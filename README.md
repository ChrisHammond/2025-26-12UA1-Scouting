# Scouting Portal (Astro + Tailwind) — **Starter**

An almost-maybe-ready-to-use Astro site for youth hockey scouting: teams, tournaments, games, plus **MyHockeyRankings (MHR)** rating/record/ranks and a rating-history chart.

I dev/build this repo on a local linux machine that has Astro and Node installed. You may be able to run it 100% from Netlify without having a local build, but debugging any issues may become difficult. 

You can view what this looks like on our [LIVE PRODUCTION](https://hockey.chrishammond.com/) site.

## Features
- **Opponent scouting portal** built with Astro 5 + Tailwind (dark, Falcons-themed).
- **Teams directory** from `src/content/teams/*.json` with detail pages, records, MHR links, and optional **team notes** (e.g., tryout status).
- **League table** filtered by league/division with **MHR Rating**, **State/National ranks**, and trend **arrows** (▲/▼/■) from recent rank history.
- **Tournaments** index + detail pages showing participating teams and their **current MHR ranks**.
- **Schedule** combines **manual games** and **auto-imported ICS** (webcal) games with de-duplication and source labeling.
- **Win probability** badge on schedule and matchup pages using a simple logistic model based on rating difference.
- **Matchup pages** (`/matchups/<opponent>/`) with two-team **rating trend chart**, quick compare chips, and head-to-head preview.
- **Rating history charts** (Chart.js) per team with time-series of MHR rating.
- **Multi-team rating comparison** chart (homepage widget) for top or selected teams.
- **“Last built”** timestamp in the footer (America/Chicago) for freshness.
- **Content-first architecture** using `astro:content` schemas (Teams, Tournaments, Games) with strong typing.
- **Configurable settings** (portal name, your team slug/name, league, division) consumed across pages/layouts.
- **MyHockeyRankings fields** per team: rating, state rank, national rank, URLs, and **history tracking** JSONs.
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions cron (daily) runs update scripts, commits changes, and can **trigger Netlify** via a build hook.
- **ICS updater script** normalizes webcal → https, parses `.ics`, and maps events into uniform game objects.
- **Static prerendering** via `getStaticPaths()` for teams, tournaments, and matchups.
- **Responsive UI** with semantic tables/cards, hover states, and accessible link styles.
- **Branding assets** including favicon to match team identity.
- **Graceful fallbacks** when data is incomplete (e.g., missing ratings/history show em dashes).
- **Developer ergonomics**: small utilities for probability, schedule normalization, and history updates; clear folder structure.

## Quick Start

**Prereqs:** Node 18+ (20/22 OK), Git.

```bash
# 1) Clone your copy
git clone https://github.com/ChrisHammond/2025-26-12UA1-Scouting my-scouting-portal
cd my-scouting-portal

# 2) Install dependencies
npm install

# 3) Generate content types (first time / after schema changes)
npx astro sync

# 4) Run the dev server
npm run dev    # http://localhost:4321

# 5) Build static site
npm run build  # output in /dist
```

---

## Configure Your Portal (branding & defaults)

Edit **src/config/settings.ts** and update these values:

- `portalName` – Site title in the header/footer and default `<title>`.
- `teamName` – Your team’s display name.
- `teamSlug` – Slug for your team (used to hide/highlight in lists).
- `leagueName` – Default league shown on the homepage table.
- `divisionName` – Default division/level on the homepage table.

> The homepage league table reads these settings by default. You can still override props directly where `<LeagueTable />` is used if you want.

---

## Add Your Data (content files)

All season data lives in **/src/content**. You’ll mainly add/edit JSON files.

### Teams
Create one file per team in **src/content/teams/**:
```json
{
  "name": "YOUR TEAM NAME",
  "slug": "your-team-slug",
  "division": "12U A1",
  "league": "MO Hockey",
  "website": "https://yourteam.example.com",
  "mhrUrl": "https://myhockeyrankings.com/team_info.php?y=2025&t=XXXXX",
  "record": "0-0-0",
  "rating": 0,
  "mhrStateRank": 0,
  "mhrNationalRank": 0,
  "lastUpdated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "notes": "Text based notes to be displayed on a team page"
}
```
> Only `name` and `slug` are required to start. The updater fills `rating`, `record`, ranks, and `lastUpdated` if `mhrUrl` is present.

### Tournaments
Create files in **src/content/tournaments/**:
```json
{
  "name": "River City Classic",
  "slug": "river-city-classic",
  "location": "St. Louis, MO",
  "startDate": "2025-10-10",
  "endDate": "2025-10-12",
  "website": "https://tournament-site.example.com",
  "opponents": ["your-team-slug", "opponent-slug-2"]
}
```

### Games
Create files in **src/content/games/**:
```json
{
  "date": "2025-09-20",
  "opponent": "opponent-slug",
  "homeAway": "Home",
  "leagueGame": true,
  "tournament": "river-city-classic",
  "venue": "Arena 1",
  "result": "W",
  "scoreFor": 5,
  "scoreAgainst": 2
}
```
> After adding a lot of new content files or changing the schema in `src/content/config.ts`, run `npx astro sync` once.

## Updates for Various Software Bits
This repo includes scripts that update various data points. You can run them manually or set up a cron job (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run them daily and commit changes.


### CLI Scripts - Astro build commands

- `npm run dev` — start Astro dev server.
- `npm run build` — build the static site.
- `npm run preview` — preview the production build locally.
- `npm run astro -- <args>` — pass-through to the Astro CLI (e.g., `npm run astro -- sync`).

### Data Updaters

- `npm run update:schedules` — fetch calendars (ICS) and write auto games to `src/data/auto-schedule/<team>.json`.
  - Examples:
    - `npm run update:schedules`
    - `npm run update:schedules -- --team=chesterfield-a1`

- `npm run update:teams` — scrape MHR for teams in `src/content/teams/` (when `mhrUrl` is set); update `record`, `rating`, ranks, and append to `src/data/mhr-history/<slug>.json`.
  - Examples:
    - `npm run update:teams`
    - `npm run update:teams -- --slug=rockets-a1`
    - `npm run update:teams -- --dry-run`

- `npm run update:tournaments:inline` — update **inline** tournament opponents (objects inside each tournament’s `opponents` array) from MHR; fills `record`, `rating`, ranks, and `updatedFromMHRAt`.
  - Examples:
    - `npm run update:tournaments:inline`
    - `npm run update:tournaments:inline -- --tournament=rock-n-roll-cup-cleveland`
    - `npm run update:tournaments:inline -- --force`
    - `npm run update:tournaments:inline -- --debug`
    - `npm run update:tournaments:inline -- --dump-html`

- `npm run update:all` — run all data refreshers in sequence:
  - `update:schedules` → `update:teams` → `update:tournaments:inline`.
  - Example: `npm run update:all`

## Deploy on Netlify

1. Push your repo to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.  
2. In Netlify, **Add new site → Import from Git** and select your repo.  
3. **Build command:** `npm run build`  
4. **Publish directory:** `dist`

> Optional: set `site` in `astro.config.mjs` for canonical URLs/sitemap once you have a permanent domain.

---

## Notes

- The team page’s rating-history chart uses `src/data/mhr-history/<slug>.json`. You’ll see a line once there are at least two entries (run the updater on different days).
- The footer shows a “Last built” timestamp automatically.
